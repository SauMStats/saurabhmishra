# Hello from Markdown!

This is a test post to verify the file-based blog system works.

## Features Working

- ✅ Markdown rendering
- ✅ Frontmatter parsing
- ✅ Automatic discovery

## Math Support

The equation $E = mc^2$ should render inline.

Display equation:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_G G + \beta_E E + \beta_{GE} G \times E + \boldsymbol{\gamma}^T \mathbf{C} + \varepsilon
$$

## Code Support

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello from code!")
```

That's it! This post should appear on your blog automatically.
